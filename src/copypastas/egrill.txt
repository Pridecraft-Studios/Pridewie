Everyone jokes about grilling, but they all forget about people like me. I have existed in a constant state of grilling since a BBQ in 1997. I have been attending this charcoal grill for twenty-two years. Do you genuinely think I can make time to argue about politics? Don't make me laugh. I have been flipping this exact burger for a third of my life. It's been decades why is it still raw. It's literally not cooking and I'm not allowed to leave. It's been over a fucking a flame for 22 years and it's still fucking frozen. What fucking vengeful god cursed me with this. help
